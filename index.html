            <h1>Study Consent Form</h1>
            <br>
            <h2>Who conducts this study?</h2>
            <p>This is a psychological experiment conducted by <b>Dr. Eric Schulz</b>, research group leader at
                the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics, and the
                members of his lab.
            </p>

            <h2>Who can participate?</h2>
            <p>
                In order to consent to participate, you must meet the
                following criteria:
                <li>You are at least <b>18 years</b> old</li>
                <li>You can fluently comprehend <b>English</b> text</li>
                <li>You have <b>not previously participated</b> in this experiment</li>
            </p>

            <h2>What is the goal of this study?</h2>
            <p>This study is designed to assess how similar a set of abstract images are to
                people. You will see pairs of images and be asked to rate their similarity.</p>

            <h2>Duration, timeout and compensation</h2>
            <p>The study will take about 10 minutes. Please respond to a given task within 60 seconds, otherwise the
                experiment will time out and your data will be lost. Upon successful completion of the experiment, we
                will pay you 3â‚¬.</p>

            <h2>Study withdrawal</h2>
            <p>Your participation in this research is voluntary. You may refrain from
                answering any questions that make you uncomfortable and may withdraw your
                participation at any time without penalty by exiting this task and alerting
                the experimenter. You may choose not to complete certain parts of the task
                or answer certain questions. You may contact us at the address provided
                below if you have additional questions or concerns.</p>

            <h2>Anonymity</h2>
            <p>Your online username may be connected to your individual responses, but
                we will not be asking for any additional personally identifying information,
                and we will handle responses as confidentially as possible. We cannot however
                guarantee the confidentiality of information transmitted over the Internet.
                We will be keeping de-identified data collected as part of this experiment
                indefinitely. Data used in scientific publications will remain completely
                anonymous.</p>

            <h2>Contacting us</h2>

                    prescribed provisions.
                    As a general rule, the storage occurs in the form of questionnaires, as well as on electronic data
                    media, for
                    10 years
                    or longer, if this is required by the purpose of the study.</li>
